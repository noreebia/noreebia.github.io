                        <dt>Java</dt>
                        <dd>Java is my go-to language. Whether it's writing a linked-list from scratch or creating industrial-strength
                            web servers with Spring Boot, I've done it all with Java. While I do not know the complete ins
                            and outs of the low-level implementation of the JVM and the garbage collector, I am familiar with almost all the data structures
                            as well as general programming knowledge (threads, exception handling, networks, etc.). Not only
                            am I well-acquainted with the inherent object-oriented nature of the traditional Java coding style,
                            I am also familiar with the functional programming paradigm that comes with Java 8 such as anonymous
                            lambda functions, functional interfaces, and stream operations</dd>
                        <dt>Object-Oriented-Programming</dt>
                        <dd>I strive to write clean, reusable code and have familiarized myself with high-level object-oriented
                            concepts such as dependency injection, liskov substitution principle, and various design patterns.</dd>
                        <dt>Web Development</dt>
                        <dd>Possesses a good grasp of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Has a very good understanding of typical web-related
                            architecture such as client-server systems, monolith architecture, microservice architecture, as well as the decentralized peer-to-peer model. Knows
                            how an HTTP request is composed and has experience creating and maintaining production-grade RESTful systems.</dd>
                        <dt>Blockchain</dt>
                        <dd>I was part of the cryptocurrency team in a blockchain startup company, and spent my time there tinkering
                            with all the major existing cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, etc.), as well as learning how to make new
                            ones. I have a solid understanding of the essential concepts of a decentralized ledger system, as well as how to set
                            up various cryptocurrency nodes in a cloud service and interact with them remotely through
                            HTTP requests.</dd>
