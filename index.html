                    <dl>
                        <dt>Java</dt>
                        <dd>Java is my go-to language. Whether it's writing a linked-list from scratch or creating industrial-strength
                            web servers with Spring Boot, I've done it all with Java. While I do not know the complete ins
                            and outs of the low-level implementation of the JVM and the garbage collector, I am familiar
                            with almost all the data structures as well as general programming knowledge (threads, exception
                            handling, networks, etc.). Not only am I well-acquainted with the inherent object-oriented nature
                            of the traditional Java coding style, I am also familiar with the functional programming paradigm
                            that comes with Java 8 such as anonymous lambda functions, functional interfaces, and stream
                            operations
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Object-Oriented-Programming</dt>
                        <dd>I strive to write clean, reusable code and have familiarized myself with high-level object-oriented
                            concepts such as dependency injection, liskov substitution principle, and various design patterns.</dd>
                        <dt>HTML, CSS and Javascript</dt>
                        <dd>I possess a good grasp of HTML and CSS. I have a good understanding of how the DOM works under the
                            hood, and how to manipulate it accordingly to my needs. Not only do I know how to make clean
                            web pages for desktops, but I also know how use media queries and libraries such as Bootstrap
                            to create responsive websites that adjusts to the user's screen. As for Javascript, I am comfortable
                            using up-to-date ES6 syntax, and familiar with the language-specific intricacies such as variable
                            hoisting, closures, and prototypes. While I do not have any actual front-end work experience,
                            I have studied on my own time to become well-acquainted with front-end libraries such as React.js
                            and Vue.js.</dd>
                        <dt>Web Development</dt>
                        <dd> Has a very good understanding of typical web-related architecture such as client-server systems,
                            monolith architecture, microservice architecture, as well as the decentralized peer-to-peer model.
                            Knows how an HTTP request/response is composed and has experience creating and maintaining production-grade
                            RESTful systems using the Spring Boot framework.</dd>
                        <dt>Blockchain</dt>
                        <dd>I was part of the cryptocurrency team in a blockchain startup company, and spent my time there tinkering
                            with all the major existing cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, etc.), as well as learning
                            how to make new ones. I have a solid understanding of the essential concepts of a decentralized
                            ledger system, as well as how to set up various existing cryptocurrency nodes in a cloud service
                            and interact with them remotely through HTTP requests.</dd>
